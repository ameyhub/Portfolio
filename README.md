I have good understanding of python, pyspark, ETL, SQL, Nosql, Power BI and cloud though which I can perform the data cleaning and storing the data. I also have good understanding of data preprocessing - feature engineering and ML when the data is containing NAN or NULL values we have to use Imputation, handing the outliers and many more technique. 
Currently I'm performing **Risk managment bank loan perdiction model** in that I am doing the OLAP and OLTP process. In this technology we are using python language and ML libraries
